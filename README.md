### Objective:
The aim of InfuraBrowser is to interact with blockchain using a purely frontend interface by leveraging the data services provided by Infura. Our unique selling point is offering a blockchain browser service without any backend services, except for Infura.

### Plan:
- Initially, the project will focus primarily on Ethereum (ETH).
- Gradual enhancements will include:
  - Balance inquiries
  - Transaction history queries
  - Analysis of transaction frequency
- As the project progresses, support for other blockchain networks will be added.
